> A cross-platform social media app promoting productivity

## About
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020 with a few of my friends from high school. The summer 
with COVID-19 was definitely different and this project was a great way to keep us busy! We found ourselves less 
productive with all this free quarantine time, which led to the idea of OurStatus - an app to improve 
productivity.

The goal of OurStatus is to encourage productivity by creating a social media experience. The idea stems from the 
human tendency to follow the crowd. If people around you are productive, you tend to want to be productive as 
well. So OurStatus combines task tracking with social media in order to make daily goals more interesting.

## Development
The development of this project is split into 3 smaller projects, a web app, an iOS app, and an android app. 
Angular was used for the web app, Swift was used for the iOS app, and Java was used for the android app. And all 
of these apps were connected using Firebase.

Development is still in progress... more to come later!
