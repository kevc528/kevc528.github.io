# Overheard at UPenn Analysis
> Analyzing this treasured Facebook group at Penn

![Graphs](/content/images/overheard.jpg)

For this project, I did some NLP analysis of the Overheard at UPenn Facebook group. This group has posts on 
various interesting and funny phrases that students have overheard. I mainly analyzed the post structure and 
overall sentiment to get a closer idea of what Penn students like to talk about.

To analyze the posts, I downloaded a CSV file of a few months of data (~500 posts) and analyzed it using Python. 
In Python, I used NLTK (actually developed at Penn!), which is a useful package for natural language processing. 
This made it very easy to analyze the language structure of the posts.
