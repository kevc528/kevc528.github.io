<h2>About</h2>

<p>It's pretty common for software engineers and techies to have their own websites nowadays to showcase any 
cool projects and discuss technical thoughts. This post discusses the journey of how I made this website. 
Working on this website is a fun and relaxing way to learn and try out new web technologies. I've already 
rebuilt this website using new implementations, and hope to continue rebuilding and revamping the site.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Version 1: Django</h3>

<p>The first iteration of my website was actually built as a final project for a Python programming class I took 
during my freshman spring. During the time, I was interested in learning more about web development... so I 
thought why not make a personal website.</p>

<p>What's really nice about the Django framework is it's connectivity with SQL databases, especially with how it's 
models directly directly mapped to database structure. During this version of the website, I would store all my 
posts and projects in the database... but using a database seemed a little bit extra for this.</p>

<p>It might also be notable to mention that I also took advantage of this database connectivity to create a 
discussion section for my posts. To be fair, what motivated me to do this was because I felt like I needed to 
take advantage of the dynamic web features of Django. But after rethinking the goal of my website, I decided that 
wasn't very necessary and wasn't worth all the moving parts required. This leads me into the second version of my 
website.</p>

<h3>Version 2: JavaScript + jQuery</h3>

<p>As I moved into the summer after my freshman year, I had more time to work on projects and learn something new. 
I was especially interested in learning more about web development and thought it would be a perfect time to 
redo my website... especially since Django seemed a bit extra for a basically static website. I wanted something 
that was lightweight and had a UI that was easy to change.</p>

<p>During this time, I was doing a lot of work with Angular through my internship and other projects, but that also 
seemed a bit intense for the purpose of this website. Instead, I decided to go with using JavaScript and jQuery, 
a pretty standard choice. At the time I didn't have much experience with jQuery and saw this as a good 
opportunity to try it out. That being said, having worked with Angular during the same time period, I did miss the modularity, organization, and connectivity/interactivity that Angular had.</p>

<p>Actual development for this version wasn't too bad. I reused some of the templates I already had from the Django 
version and used JavaScript and jQuery to replicate the same functionality. jQuery was really nice for increasing 
interactivity of the website, like filtering project list based on the tag clicked, and also reducing the amount 
of repeated HTML I had to write.</p>

<p>The one big change I had to make in my transition from Django was how I was going to store my posts, like this 
one. Originally in Django, I would just put it in the database, but now I need a new solution. I knew that I 
definitely didn't want to have to write HTML for each new post created. In the end, I decided to write all my 
posts in Markdown, and then have a script that converts the posts to HTML. This made changing and 
adding posts a much better experience.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with the changes that I made to for this version; especially since everything is 
lightweight and easy to use.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Now that I'm pretty much wrapped up on the JS/jQuery version of my website, I'm looking to see if there are any other tech stacks for me to try out and potentially rebuild the website with. I've heard quite a bit about 
Gatsby/React and this might be the next step for this site...</p>
